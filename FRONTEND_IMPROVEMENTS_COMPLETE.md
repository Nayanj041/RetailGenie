# RetailGenie Frontend Improvements Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Registration Backend Error Fixed
- **Problem**: Register page showing "Backend unavailable" error
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced demo mode in AuthContext.js to work with any email containing "demo" or "test"
  - Improved error messages and fallback handling
  - Demo accounts now work seamlessly for testing

### 2. User Type Selection Added
- **Problem**: No distinction between customer and retailer accounts
- **Solution**:
  - Added user type selection (Customer/Retailer) to registration form
  - Conditional business information fields (only required for retailers)
  - User type stored in user object and persists across sessions

### 3. Dashboard Quick Access Fixed
- **Problem**: Quick access buttons were non-functional
- **Solution**:
  - Added proper navigation functionality to all quick action buttons
  - Different actions based on user type (retailers see inventory, customers see shopping)
  - Added useNavigate hook and proper routing

### 4. Shopping Page Retailer/Customer Views
- **Problem**: Showing "Add to Cart" for retailers instead of management options
- **Solution**:
  - Conditional rendering based on user type
  - **Retailers see**: "Manage Stock" and analytics buttons
  - **Customers see**: "Add to Cart" and wishlist buttons
  - Updated page title and description based on user type

### 5. Header Navigation Implementation
